  <!-- 1. Water System EPA Compliance -->
  <div class="project-item">
    <h2>Water System EPA Compliance</h2>

    </a>
    <p class="project-description">
      This study investigated the impact of public versus private ownership on the EPA regulatory compliance of California water systems. Python and R were used to build statistical and machine learning models that account for group-level differences in the longitudinal panel data. Multilevel Negative Binomial Mixed Effects models were utilized to address the research question. A feature importance analysis was also conducted with a Mixed Effects Gradient Boosting Tree model.

    </a>
    <p class="project-description">
      Developed a gunshot detection application using Python, Flask, AWS SageMaker, and hosted on Heroku, enabling accurate identification of gunshot sounds from audio data. Feature engineering techniques were used extensively to extract meaningful features from raw audio data for the Keras Neural Network model.

  <!-- 3. Customer Churn Analysis -->
  <div class="project-item">
    <h2>Customer Churn Analysis</h2>

      <img src="/assets/images/churn-analysis-classification.png" alt="Customer Churn Analysis" class="project-image" loading="lazy">
    </a>
    <p class="project-description">
      Conducted a comprehensive customer churn analysis in Python, using clustering algorithms such as K-Means, K-Prototypes, and K-Medoids to identify patterns and classification algorithms to predict customer attrition. A Histogram-based Gradient Boosting Tree model was found to be the best predictive model based on ROC-AUC score and other relevant metrics.
